For example, [ x*2 for x in range(1,11) ] is a simple list comprehension. This would iterate over the range 1 to 10, and multiply each element in the range by 2. This would result in a list of the multiples of 2, from 2 to 20.

You can also use conditionals with list comprehensions to build even more complex and powerful statements. You can do this by appending an if statement to the end of the comprehension. For example, [ x for x in range(1,101) if x % 10 == 0 ] would generate a list containing all the integers divisible by 10 from 1 to 100.
